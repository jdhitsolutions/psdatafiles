# PowerShell Data Files Demo Material
This repository contains presentation material and demos about using different data types in your PowerShell scripting. The material in its current state was presented at the PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit in April 2018

All material was developed and tested with Windows 10 running PowerShell 5.1.16299. It is assumed you are looking at the demo material using either the PowerShell ISE or Visual Studio Code. Set your location to the Demos folder.

If you would like to learn more about PowerShell scripting, I recommend getting a copy of [The PowerShell Scripting and Toolmaking Book](http://bit.ly/PSToolmaking). You can find my PowerShell related video training courses at [Pluralsight.com](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/jeff-hicks). I am also available for private PowerShell-related classes should your company have a number of people requiring training. Email learning@jdhitsolutions.com if you are interested.

**Everything here should be considered educational material and is not considered production ready.**
